This program uses ADB commands within a Windows application to create backups of partitions and apps, and it includes recovery options. It offers a method to find and back up specific file types, such as images and music, on the device. Additionally, it allows the device to be rebooted into Recovery, Bootloader, or Fastboot mode. Users can install apps, change the device password or PIN, or, if they have root access, fully remove the lock. There are also various other features available. The program is currently in its beta phase.
